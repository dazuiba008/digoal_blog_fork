Optimize WAL insertion lock acquisition and release with some atomics  
  
The WAL insertion lock variable insertingAt is currently being read  
and written with the help of the LWLock wait list lock to avoid any read  
of torn values.  This wait list lock can become a point of contention on  
a highly concurrent write workloads.  
  
This commit switches insertingAt to a 64b atomic variable that provides  
torn-free reads/writes.  On platforms without 64b atomic support, the  
fallback implementation uses spinlocks to provide the same guarantees  
for the values read.  LWLockWaitForVar(), through  
LWLockConflictsWithVar(), reads the new value to check if it still needs  
to wait with a u64 atomic operation.  LWLockUpdateVar() updates the  
variable before waking up the waiters with an exchange_u64 (full memory  
barrier).  LWLockReleaseClearVar() now uses also an exchange_u64 to  
reset the variable.  Before this commit, all these steps relied on  
LWLockWaitListLock() and LWLockWaitListUnlock().  
  
This reduces contention on LWLock wait list lock and improves  
performance of highly-concurrent write workloads.  Here are some  
numbers using pg_logical_emit_message() (HEAD at d6677b93) with various  
arbitrary record lengths and clients up to 1k on a rather-large machine  
(64 vCPUs, 512GB of RAM, 16 cores per sockets, 2 sockets), in terms of  
TPS numbers coming from pgbench:

Bharath has been measuring similar improvements, where the limit of the  
WAL insertion lock begins to be felt when more than 256 concurrent  
clients are involved in this specific workload.  
  
An extra patch has been discussed to introduce a fast-exit path in  
LWLockUpdateVar() when there are no waiters, still this does not  
influence the write-heavy workload cases discussed as there are always  
waiters.  This will be considered separately.
